# Decentralized Genomic Data Marketplace

A blockchain-based platform enabling secure sharing and monetization of genomic data while maintaining privacy and control for data providers.

## Overview

The Decentralized Genomic Data Marketplace is a smart contract ecosystem that facilitates the secure exchange of genomic data between providers (individuals/institutions) and researchers. The platform ensures data privacy, transparent research processes, and fair compensation for data providers.

## System Architecture

The marketplace consists of four main smart contracts:

### 1. DNA Data Contract
- Securely stores genomic data references and metadata
- Implements encryption and data integrity verification
- Maintains data versioning and history
- Handles data upload and retrieval processes

### 2. Access Control Contract
- Manages permissions for data access
- Implements role-based access control (RBAC)
- Handles user authentication and authorization
- Maintains audit logs of data access
- Enables data providers to revoke access

### 3. Research Proposal Contract
- Facilitates submission of research proposals
- Implements proposal review and approval workflow
- Tracks proposal status and outcomes
- Manages researcher reputation scores
- Enables community feedback on proposals

### 4. Compensation Contract
- Handles automated payments to data providers
- Implements flexible payment models
- Manages escrow for research funding
- Tracks payment history and distributions
- Handles dispute resolution

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ethereum wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- Node.js v16.0 or higher
- Truffle Suite
- IPFS node (for data storage)

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/genomic-marketplace

# Install dependencies
cd genomic-marketplace
npm install

# Deploy contracts
truffle migrate --network <network-name>
```

## Usage

### For Data Providers
1. Connect wallet and verify identity
2. Upload genomic data through the DNA Data Contract
3. Set access permissions and pricing
4. Review and approve research proposals
5. Receive compensation for data usage

### For Researchers
1. Submit research proposals through the Research Proposal Contract
2. Provide funding for data access
3. Access approved data through secure channels
4. Submit research outcomes and updates

## Security Considerations

- All genomic data is encrypted using industry-standard protocols
- Smart contracts are audited by independent security firms
- Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
- Regular security updates and vulnerability assessments
- Privacy-preserving computation methods implemented
